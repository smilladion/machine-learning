# Neural Networks

The purpose of this program is to experiment with different classification methods used in machine learning on a dataset from Zalando, which consists of a collection of clothing article images. The classifiers in question include a variety of models, both linearly separable classifiers such as logistic regression, as well as multi-layered neural networks such as MLPs and CNNs.

The tools used along with Python are Jupyter Notebook, SKLearn, Pytorch and Tensorflow. 

Note that the dataset has not been uploaded to the repository due to size.
